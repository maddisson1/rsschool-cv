### Summary ###  
Teacher/mentor with a 1,5 years of experience in working at programming school, teaching children and adults. Working with people helped me to realize that I want to be helpful in a more global sense - helping people by solving some specific issues. I do believe that to be a 'programmer' means not just to 'develop some product', but to 'solve a real human problem'. Knowing I can be useful, along with responsibility and ability to learn easy and quick assist me on my way in IT.
